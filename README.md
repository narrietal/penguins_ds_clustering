## Project description
In this project we work with the Palmer Penguins Data Set to apply clustering techniques in order to classify penguins. 

The notebook includes the following sections
* **Data preprocessing** (Exploration, Cleaning, Encoding, Reduction and Scaling)
* **K-Means** (silhouette and elbow analysis)
* **Spectral clustering** (similarity graphs and eigen vector analysis)
